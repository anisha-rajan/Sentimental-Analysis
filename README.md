# Sentimental-Analysis
This project implements a Sentiment Analysis application using Hugging Face Transformers and Gradio. It utilizes a pre-trained sentiment analysis model to analyze text input and determine the sentiment (e.g., Positive, Negative, Neutral) along with a confidence score. The application provides a user-friendly web interface via Gradio, making it easy for users to interact with the model. The project supports multilingual sentiment analysis when using an appropriate model. Installation is simple with Python dependencies including transformers, gradio, and torch. Users can run the application locally or deploy it on Hugging Face Spaces with minimal setup. The interface allows users to input text, and the model returns the predicted sentiment along with the confidence score. This project is open-source under the MIT License and is built using state-of-the-art NLP models provided by Hugging Face.
